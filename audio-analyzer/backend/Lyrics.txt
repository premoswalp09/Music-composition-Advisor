I've been reading books of old	The legends and the myths	Achilles and his gold	Hercules and his gifts	Spiderman's control	And Batman with his fists	And clearly I don't see myself upon that listBut she said, where'd you wanna go?	How much you wanna risk?	I'm not looking for somebody	With some superhuman gifts	Some superhero	Some fairytale bliss	Just something I can turn to	Somebody I can kissI want something just like this	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo	Oh, I want something just like this	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-dooOh, I want something just like this	I want something just like thisI've been reading books of old	The legends and the myths	The testaments they told	The moon and its eclipse	And Superman unrolls	A suit before he lifts	But I'm not the kind of person that it fitsShe said, where'd you wanna go?	How much you wanna risk?	I'm not looking for somebody	With some superhuman gifts	Some superhero	Some fairytale bliss	Just something I can turn to	Somebody I can missI want something just like this	I want something just like thisOh, I want something just like this	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo	Oh, I want something just like this	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo	Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-dooWhere'd you wanna go?	How much you wanna risk?
